# Download-A-Website
This is a python script that allows people to enter the url of a stunning website, and download the index file along with all the CSS, JS, and image files. It then places these files into organized directories labeled "CSS", "JS", and "IMG". Users now can simply click on the "webpage.html" file that the python script creates to view their download of the website.
